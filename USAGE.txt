 0. Program Files
 =============

 The program files are:

   Application       Command      Alternatively call from
   -----------------------------------------------------
   Tsunami server    tsunamid     ./server/tsunamid
   Tsunami client    tsunami      ./client/tsunami
   Realtime server   rttsunamid   ./rtserver/rttsunamid
   Realtime client   rttsunami    ./rtclient/rttsunami

 If you have followed COMPILING.txt and the "sudo make install",
 you can execute the program files from anywhere on the command
 line.

 If you omitted the "sudo make install", you'll have to call
 the programs from within the source code directories.

 For the general overview on how the Tsunami protocol
 works, please see the older README.txt


 1. Very Quick Guide
 ================

 --Server--

 On the server PC, go to the directory where you
 have the files that should be served, and
 start the Tsunami server with e.g.:
 $ cd /where/my/files/are
 $ tsunamid

 The server serves files from its current
 working directory.

 To allow clients to use the "GET *" command,
 start the Tsunami server with:
 $ tsunamid *
 or
 $ tsunamid fileToServe1 fileToServe2 ...

 For the realtime server extensions and its 
 file naming conventions, see the Realtime 
 Tsunami Notes section.

 --Client--

 On the client PC, start the command line client: 
 $ cd /where/to/receive/files
 $ tsunami

 The client will store downloaded files into
 the current working directory.

 Usual commands in the client are like crude FTP:
 tsunami> connect server.domain.com
 tsunami> get filename
 tsunami> get *


 2. Not So Quick Guide
 ==================

 Typical usage example where PC1 is the server and PC2 the client.

 Preparations on PC1:

 pc1$ cd /home/guest/outfiles/
 pc1$ tsunamid *

 Connecting from PC2:

 pc2$ cd /home/guest/infiles/
 pc2$ tsunami
   tsunami> set rate 512M
   rate = 512000000

   tsunami> connect myserver.domain.com
   Connected.

   tsunami> get nameoffile
   00     00      00      368      499     15.59   354.7    0.0       499    0.0   354.7    0.0       0  1      354.7
   ...

 Alternative way of connecting from PC2:
  - all commands you would enter into tsunami's own command line you
  may also concatenate onto the command line of your shell, i.e.:

 pc2$ cd /home/guest/infiles/
 pc2$ tsunami set rate 512M connect myserver.domain.com get nameoffile
   tsunami>
   00     00      00      368      499     15.59   354.7    0.0       499    0.0   354.7    0.0       0  1      354.7
   ...
   ...

 If you use the "get *" command, you can automatically download several
 files. Note if you use the above shell/command line format of concatenated
 commands and your shell does globbing, you will have to use "get \*" with
 a slash.

 4. Settings in the Tsunami Server
 ============

 $ tsunamid --help
   Usage: tsunamid [--verbose] [--transcript] [--v6] [--port=n] [--datagram=bytes] [--buffer=bytes]
                [--hbtimeout=seconds] [--allhook=cmd] [--finishhook=cmd] [filename1 filename2 ...]

   verbose or v : turns on verbose output mode
   transcript   : turns on transcript mode for statistics recording
   v6           : operates using IPv6 instead of (not in addition to!) IPv4
   port         : specifies which TCP port on which to listen to incoming connections
   secret       : specifies the shared secret for the client and server
   client       : specifies an alternate client IP or host where to send data
   datagram     : specifies the desired datagram size (in bytes)
   buffer       : specifies the desired size for UDP socket send buffer (in bytes)
   hbtimeout    : specifies the timeout in seconds for disconnect after client heartbeat lost
   finishhook   : run command on transfer completion, file name is appended automatically
   allhook      : run command on 'get *' to produce a custom file list for client downloads
   filenames    : list of files to share for downloaded via a client 'GET *'

 $ rttsunamid --help
   Usage: tsunamid [--verbose] [--transcript] [--v6] [--port=n] [--datagram=bytes] [--buffer=bytes]
                   [--hbtimeout=seconds] [--allhook=cmd] [--finishhook=cmd]
				   [--vsibmode=mode] [--vsibskip=skip] [filename1 filename2 ...]
   ...
   vsibmode     : specifies the VSIB mode to use (see VSIB documentation for modes)
   vsibskip     : a value N other than 0 will skip N samples after every 1 sample


  --client=host option:
  
    The fast UDP data are always sent to the specified host or IP, instead of being
	sent back to the TCP connection IP of the connected client. This allows 
	a single client with two IP addresses (e.g. two Ethernet adapters with 
	different IP). Be careful that the specified 'host' is correct and without
	typos, otherwise an incorrect host is flooded with UDP data...

  --hbtimeout=sec option:

    The default 'hbtimeout' after the client heartbeat is lost is 15 seconds.

    The heartbeat is identical to the packetloss report that the client sends to 
	the server in 350ms or shorter intervals. The 'hbtimeout' behaviour after the first 
	missing client packetloss report is briefly as follows:

      The server interrupts the transfer after 'hbtimeout' seconds of
      no client activity. This can happen at any completion %.
      A backupping realtime server waits until all requested data (100%) has 
      been stored to disk, and then waits for 'hbtimeout'.

    The same in more detail:

      - The file server 'tsunamid', or a realtime 'rttsunamid' that has _not_ been 
        instructed to write a local backup copy of VSIB data, will both continue 
        sending new UDP-packetized data while waiting for the next heartbeat.
      - If no heartbeat is received within the hbtimeout time, the connection is closed.
      - If an EOF of the TCP connection is encountered, the connection is closed
        immediately without timeout checks.
      - A realtime 'rttsunamid' that _has_ been instructed to write a local backup
        copy of VSIB data will continue to send data, even if there is no feedback
        from the client. 
      - Even if an EOF is encountered, the connection is not closed.
      - Only after the server has sent the last block of data (and thus the entire
        requested VSIB data is complete on the disk), the hbtimeout setting
        becomes effective.

 --finishhook=cmd option:

   If this is specified, then on completion of a file transfer the command is run with 
   the filename appended.  For example, if --finishhook=rm is specified, the transfered 
   file is simply removed (from the server) once it is transferred.  More complicated 
   things could be done in a shell script, python program, or whatever, such as sending 
   email notification, moving to a different directory, or ...

 --allhook=cmd option: 
 
   If this is specified, the provided program will be run and its output will be used as 
   the file list to be transferred.  For example, if --allhook="ls -1" is supplied on the 
   command line, the list of files in the local directory will be listed and queued for 
   retrieval.  In a more complicated situation one could do file filtration based on filename 
   on file date, or .



 5. Getting Help
 ============

 Server application, to get a list of command line options use:
 $ tsunamid --help
 
 Client application, to get a list of options use:
 $ tsunami
   tsunami> help
 And to see the current settings in the client (not persistent
 i.e. not stored between program restarts), use:
   tsunami> set

 Settings in the client can be changed using the "set" command
 which has the format:
   set [option] [value]

 You should also read the README.txt.

 Finally, look at the source code. :-)

 You can also use the sourceforge project site
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/tsunami-udp
 to add a support request or send an email to the developer(s).



 6. Realtime Tsunami Notes
 ======================
 
 The realtime version of the tsunami applications uses the 
 Metshovi VSIB card.

 This section refers mainly to the realtime versions of 
 the tsunami applications, namely, in the source code tree
 these are the ./rtserver/tsunamid and ./rtclient/tsunami
 applications.

 --VSIB driver--

 You'll need a post-01/2006 version of the vsib.c driver.
 Tsunami tries to access the VSIB card via /dev/vsib.

 If you try rates of 256Mbps and above, please check that
 your VSIB driver is loaded with a bigbufsize of at least
 100MiB. For example 144MiB often set in the file /etc/modules, 
 and the value is usually sufficient for 512Mbps:
    # load vsib with 144M 
    vsib bigbufsize=144000000

 --Realtime Server--

 The realtime server will read data from the VSIB card and send
 the data over the network. 

 The filename requested by the client in the "get" command
 tells the realtime server when to start recording. If the
 name is an EVN formatted time/date string, this will be used
 as the starting time. Otherwise, recording starts right after
 the next 1 second rollover.

 If the file name contains a path i.e. the character "/", 
 the server will locally create a file with that name. Data
 streamed to the network will then also be saved into that
 local file.

 The "EVN" file naming convention with UTC time and optional 
 recording length specified in bytes is as follows:

    [exp]_[station]_[scan]_[yyyy]-[mm]-[dd]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss].vsi   
    [exp]_[station]_[scan]_[yyyy]-[mm]-[dd]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss]_dl=[bytes].vsi

    Where     
    Exp:     experiment, arbitrary string
    Station: 2-letter station ID like for example Mh, Jb, Wb, Mc, ...
    Scan:    name of the scan, arbitrary, format often similar to "fr0089"
    Date:    US order, month first
    Time:    UTC time
    Bytes:   dl file length in bytes, length of recording
    
 Examples:

    Metshovi station, begin recording on 17th Oct 2006 at 12:25:30UTC
  
       exp01_mh_scan01_2006-10-17T12:25:30.vsi
    
    Same as above but also make a local backup on the server 
    into the /i1/ directory (should be a fast RAID0 disk):
  
      /i1/exp01_mh_scan01_2006-10-17T12:25:30.vsi

    Recording length specified to be 1536000000 bytes.
    
      exp01_mh_scan01_2006-10-17T12:25:30_dl=1536000000.vsi
      

 The default recording length is equal to the amount of bytes
 in 4 minutes of 512 Mbps.      
        
 The VSIB recording mode can be specified from the
 command line options (--vsibmode=x, --vsibskip=x).
 
 If you use a version older than v1.1 cvsbuild 32, you
 are limited to
    > set blocksize 4096  [or 8192, 16384, 32768]
 as other settings cause skips in the data.


 --Realtime Client--

 The realtime client will write back data from the network
 to the VSIB card, i.e. is in "playback" mode. Again, the 
 playback mode is hard-coded but now in
   ./rtclient/vsibctl.c
 [Note: realtime client untested after JR wrote it in 2003]

 To transfer a file from memory/VSIB-in to disk, use the
 realtime server and normal client i.e.:
    pc1$ rttsunamid
    pc2$ tsunami

 To transfer a file from disk to VSIB-out, use the
 normal server and realtime client i.e.:
    pc1$ tsunamid
    pc2$ rttsunami

 To transfer a file from VSIB-in to VSIB-out, use the
 realtime server and realtime client i.e.:
    pc1$ rttsunamid
    pc2$ rttsunami
    (this is not fully tested yet)


    
 7. Special Compile Settings
 ========================

 For real-time server:
 
  ./rtserver/io.c 
  
    //#define MODE_34TH   
    
       uncomment to enable 3/4th rate transmission,
       discards upper 4 channels (2 BBCs)
                          
 For normal client:
  
  ./client/protocol.c
  
    #define RETX_REQBLOCK_SORTING
    
       define to use linear sorting of blocks in the retransmit 
       request, fast, discards duplicates, may improve disk I/O 
       since more contiguous access on server side
       
    
 8. Troubleshooting
 ===============

 * If transfers are really slow, and the error rate is high,
 check the following on both the client and server:

   - no other programs should run in the background
     and use lots of cpu: 
     check with e.g. 'top'

   - you are really writing to or reading from a fast 
     RAID disk: 
     check with for example 
     'sudo hdparm -t /dev/md0' or
     'sudo hdparm -t /dev/sdb' 
     that the disk where you have the Tsunami data is
     sufficiently fast compared to Tsunami target Mbps data rate
     
 * If no data goes through over the connection, check that
 no firewalls are blocking the default TCP and UDP port 46224.
 This can also be tested using the 'netcat' (or 'nc') linux/unix
 command line tool.
   pc1$ netcat -u -l -p 46224 
   pc2$ netcat -u pc1.domain.com 46224
 and typing in something into pc2 and hitting <enter> should
 then appear on the pc1 as netcat output, unless there are
 firewall problems.

 Firewall settings, server side: TCP 46224 incoming allowed
 Firewall settings, client side: UDP 46224 incoming allowed

 * Another possibility is MTU mismatch and no path MTU discovery.
 Tsunami uses a default block size of 32768 bytes. In the 
 client you could change this to below 10 Mbit LAN MTU using
 the client console command 
   tsunami>  set blocksize 1430
 and then reattempt the transfer (commands: connect, get). If
 this works, then you or your ISP need to fix the network MTU.

 * If you get "could not create socket on port xxx" errors, this
 very likely means a zombie tsunamid or tsunami process is 
 running. Try killing that process ('ps axuf', 'kill') or 
 rebooting if it is really stuck.

 * Try to avoid using the JFS file system (till kernel 2.6.18
 or even later) together with Tsunami and RAID, as Tsunami disk 
 thread blocking may hang JFS. In the worst case you loose all 
 data on the file system. Other file systems like EXT3, XFS work 
 just fine, so it is a JFS bug. 

 * If problems persist, contact the developers or submit a bug report 
 at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tsunami-udp

 * If you use a version older than v1.1 cvsbuild 32, you are limited to
    > set blocksize 4096  [or 8192, 16384, 32768]
 as other settings cause skips in the data.
