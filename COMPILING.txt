Get the code 
============

If you have not yet downloaded the source code, you can do so with
an anonymous CVS checkout:

   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@tsunami-udp.cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/tsunami-udp co -P tsunami-udp

Later you can use the usual

   cvs update

command to get and merge updates from the CVS into your local copy 
of the code.

   
Compiling
=========   

 If you want to build Tsunami for a big endian i.e. non-Intel platform,
 first edit ./common/Makefile.am and see instructions there.

 For compiling tsunami, simply use:

   $ make

 From the configure output errors find all those missing packages that you 
 had never even heard of and install them, then try a ./configure again.

 If there are ./configure complaints about Makefile.in or similar, try:

   $ ./recompile.sh

 That should build the entire tsunami, including everything in
 the subdirectories (in /server, /client, etc).
 To compile for Solaris see the ./configure flags in recompile.sh.

 An optional 

   $ sudo make install

 will install the tsunami binaries onto the system. 
 The binaries that will be installed are:

   App              Name        From
   Tsunami server   tsunamid    ./server/tsunamid 
   Tsunami client   tsunami     ./client/tsunami
   Realtime server  rttsunamid  ./rtserver/rttsunamid
   Realtime client  rttsunami   ./rtclient/rttsunami

 The binaries will be placed into /usr/local/bin or similar.

 Contents of individual subdirectories can be recompiled with
 for example

   $ cd client
   $ make clean
   $ make

 (Note that you first have to compile the entire 
 source tree via './configure' and 'make'. Only after that you
 can recompile individual subdirectories without problems)
 
 
 Special compile settings
 ========================

 For real-time server:
 
  ./rtserver/io.c 
  
    //#define MODE_34TH   
    
       uncomment to enable 3/4th rate transmission,
       discards upper 4 channels (2 BBCs)
                          
 For normal client:
  
  ./client/protocol.c
  
    #define RETX_REQBLOCK_SORTING
    
       define to use linear sorting of blocks in the retransmit 
       request, fast, discards duplicates, may improve disk I/O 
       since more contiguous access on server side
       
 For compiling on Solaris:

   $ ./configure CC=gcc CPPFLAGS=-Du_int64_t=uint64_t -Du_int32_t=uint32_t \
       -Du_int16_t=uint16_t -Du_int8_t=uint8_t LIBS=-lsocket -lnsl -lrt 

   If gcc is not avaliable one needs to remove the -Wall from EXTRA_FLAGS 
   otherwise it fails.
